# Workshop materials: Datasets for artists

A notebook for creating a simple image classifier (FastAI) and a script for webcam inference. 

Both were used in my workshop "Datasets for artists" at Peckham Digital festival on 12 September 2021. 

After training and exporting the model with the notebook, do the following:

1) Create an empty folder for webcam_classifier.py
2) Add an empty subfolder colled "model". Place the .pkl model there
3) Create a Python virtual environment 
4) Run ``pip install python-opencv``, ``pip install pytorch``, ``pip install fastai`` 
5) Run the inference: python webcam_classifier.py
